      <h2>Community Hospital – USP <797> Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        A 150-bed community hospital faced citation risks due to an outdated compounding space. Our team performed a full gap assessment, redesigned their cleanroom suite, and implemented a comprehensive training and QA program. Result: USP <797> compliance in 12 weeks and successful Joint Commission audit.

      <h2>Regional Medical Center – Hazardous Drug Room Retrofit</h2>
      <p>
        We retrofitted a negative-pressure HD buffer room, installed an externally vented CACI, and trained staff on USP <800> PPE and deactivation protocols. The project met HCAI requirements and passed environmental monitoring on the first run.

      <h2>Rural Critical Access Hospital – Staff Training Success</h2>
      <p>
        For a rural hospital with no prior sterile compounding program, we delivered media fill training, SOP development, and fingertip/glove qualification. Result: 100% staff pass rate on initial validation.
