    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h2>Do I need a cleanroom or can I use an SCA?</h2>
    <p>
      For low-risk, short BUD products, a Segregated Compounding Area (SCA) may be sufficient. However, medium/high-risk CSPs require ISO-classified cleanrooms per USP <797>.
    </p>

    <h2>How long does it take to become USP compliant?</h2>
    <p>
      Typical compliance timelines range from 8 to 16 weeks, depending on the scope of renovation, staff readiness, and documentation needs.
    </p>

    <h2>Whatâ€™s the difference between USP <797> and <800>?</h2>
    <p>
      USP <797> governs sterile compounding. USP <800> covers hazardous drug handling (HDs) and is often required concurrently if you prepare drugs like chemotherapy.
    </p>

    <h2>Do you help with Joint Commission or PCAB inspections?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. We provide mock audits, SOP alignment, and documentation review tailored for accreditation success.
